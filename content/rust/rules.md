# RULES:

- Don't be a prick.
- No slurs, sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia etc.
  - Report misconduct in the rust-support discord channel with screen shots/clips.
- You Must Join the Discord
- Strict Teams of 8:
  - Third party fighting is fine, but coordinating with a third party that makes your numbers greater than 8 is banworthy.
  - Raiding/sharing a base with other teams is fine AS LONG AS YOUR COMBINED NUMBERS DO NOT EXCEED 8. We may lower teams to if we get 80+ people playing consistently.
- No griefing.
  - Kill anyone you want (though killing nakeds on sight is cringe). Steal all their shit. But don't stalk them so they can't play the game.
- Raiding Outposts are allowed.
  -  BUT if they are within sniping distance of other player's bases, they must be out of line-of-sight (no snipe camping) and not used for griefing. Do your business then vacate.
- Raid Timer
  - After successfully breaching and looting a base OR forcing the team to move their base, you cannot attack that team's base for 5 days (the day after the raid is Day 1).
  - That doesn't mean you can't merc them out and about in the world. But as much as I fucking LOVE PvP and watching people get their world wrecked, I also want people to not hate life on this server. This is for balance.
  - If you hunt prey without restraint, you will quickly find you have nothing left to hunt.
  - You can still kill targets that are on raid timers in the open world.
  - If a raid victim retaliates against the enemy base, the timer is off.
  - No mercenary raids to circumvent the raid timer (e.g. you can't hire another team to raid someone you're timed out against).
